          "<p>“Money” versus “Currency”: Money and currency are terms that are often used interchangeably, but they actually represent distinct concepts. Money is a tool that facilitates the exchange of goods and services, while currency is the representation of money, like seashells, coins, or digital tokens.</p>",
          "<p>Money as “technology” or a “tool.” Money allows people to conduct transactions and trade goods and services efficiently, without the need for a direct barter system.</p>",
          "<p>Money as a solution. Without money, trading goods and services would be challenging, as it would rely on the “coincidence of wants”—finding someone who wants what you have and has what you want at exactly the same time. What if I need shoes but the cobbler doesn’t need my apples? What if my apples rot by the time they’re needed? Money solves this problem by providing a universally accepted “medium of exchange.”</p>",

In the movie Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler is excited by a new opal, whose value evolves over the course of the film. Thus the danger with collectibles: they may be new on the scene, with unknown history. Are they truly scarce? Are they truly rare?</li>" +
                "<li><b>Store of Value.</b> “This is rare, and is therefore valuable. It will hold its value, or perhaps even increase over time.” Gold has made it to this stage, retaining its value over time. Inflation and interest compromise fiat’s store of value because money’s rarity is controlled by the governmental and Federal Reserve decisions. No one can tell the earth to produce more gold, but the Fed can print more paper.</li>" +

In Thailand, the Unit of Account is the bat.” In Mexico, the U.S. dollar is still accepted as a “Medium of Exchange” and then converted to pesos, which are the local currency and “Unit of Account.”</li></ul>",

Some people buy things with it: it’s a “medium of exchange.” Others trust its ability to “store value” more than the dollar. Others point to its volatility and relegate it to “collectible.” Because money is an expression of value, we are still very much in the “price discovery” phase of bitcoin—a process that gold went through long ago.<p>",

          "<p>Long ago, tribes met their own needs with division of labor. Hunters, gatherers, preparers. If a tribal need arose, trading began: the fishing tribe would trade for furs. As tribes banded together and individual needs were met—“I no longer have to hunt for my own food; I have more time”—specialization of skills emerges. Enter individualization! Enter preferences! Things that were once “caveman categories” of sustenance and shelter become specific: spices, oils, pigments, furs, leather, tools, pots, clay, woodworking, bones, carvings, ornaments, jewelry. Art begins! Life is better!</p>",
          "<p>The “coincidence of wants” therefore becomes rarer. It’s winter. I need new shoes, but the cobbler doesn’t want my out-of-season apples. I can promise him apples in the spring—“credit”—but what if he never wants my apples? He’s allergic, or he prefers Granny Smiths. Money becomes the tool where I can still get what he offers, without him needing exactly what I provide.</p>",
          "<p>No more shoes-vs-apples (coincidence of wants). No more spring-to-fall (time constraints). No more “I can’t carry 10,000 apples everywhere I go” (space constraints).
